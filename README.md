Hipster-to-Other
=============

Chrome extension that replaces occurrences of 'hipster' with 'my internalized misconception of the youth'.

I just took the code from panicsteve's cloud-to-butt thing as my first time using Git example. He said: " Forks are free to do whatever they like.  But officially, _this_
extension replaces only the phrase described above. Thank you for your concern."

Thank you panicsteve.
