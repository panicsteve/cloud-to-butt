cloud-to-butt
=============

Chrome extension that replaces occurrences of 'the cloud' with 'my butt'

[Direct download of crx file](https://github.com/panicsteve/cloud-to-butt/blob/master/CloudToButt.crx?raw=true)

Note that there are forks of this extension that simply replace 'cloud' with 'butt'.
In my personal opinion, that approach is too broad and it's less funny as a result, but it is clearly a very
polarizing issue in the cloud-to-butt user community.  Forks are free to do whatever they like.  But officially, _this_
extension replaces only the phrase described above. Thank you for your concern.
